We try to answer common questions in our [docs]. Here are our most frequently asked questions:

* How should I format the title? [link][title]
* What should I include in the description? [link][description] 
* How do I share an example? We use [glitch] to share examples. Here is a [template] you can remix!

Of course, if you have any questions you should stop by our [slack]. 
There's often someone in your timezone who'll be happy to help!
